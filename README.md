# 2. Designing system architecture

## Frontend (Next.js)
The sleek, user-friendly interface where customers explore products, manage their carts, and complete purchases.

## Sanity CMS
Your dynamic database, acting as the control center for managing product information and tracking orders in real-time.

## Third-Party APIs
The powerhouse connectors that handle secure payments and provide live shipment tracking updates for customers.

## How It All Works â€“ The Data Flow:

1. **Shop & Explore**: Customers browse your marketplace on the Next.js frontend, enjoying a smooth and responsive experience.

2. **Data on Demand**: The frontend fetches up-to-date product details from Sanity CMS via API calls, ensuring accurate and real-time data.

3. **Seamless Orders**: When an order is placed, the system stores the details in Sanity CMS for centralized management.

4. **Track in Real-Time**: Shipment tracking APIs fetch and display live order status updates, keeping customers informed every step of the way.

5. **Secure Payments**: The payment gateway processes transactions safely, ensuring trust and reliability.

6. **Perfect Sync**: The system harmoniously syncs data between the frontend, Sanity CMS, and third-party services, delivering a seamless shopping journey.

# 5. Key Takeaways from Today

## Clear Communication Between Frontend, Backend, and APIs
The frontend (what users see) communicates with the backend (the server) through APIs, sharing data like product details and orders. This smooth communication ensures everything works seamlessly for the user.

## Well-Defined System Architecture
A well-structured system keeps everything organized, with clear paths for data to flow between components like the frontend, backend, and databases. This organization helps everything run smoothly and efficiently.

## Planned API Structure and Key Workflows
APIs are carefully designed to handle important tasks such as displaying products, processing orders, and tracking shipments. This thoughtful design makes the system work quickly and reliably.

## Focus on Scalability, Security, and Efficiency
The system is built to handle growth, protect user data, and operate efficiently. These three factors ensure a strong, dependable platform for users.
